Just stumbled out of the drone of the theater, popcorn stuck to my shoes and somehow in my hair - I swear it was gravity-defying popcorn. Uppercut. Or should I call it a punch in the soul? The opening scene hit harder than that old elevator at work that never quite stops at the right floor. Noisy kids in the back row, their laughter during that serious bit where he’s staring at the neon lights like they’re whispering secrets only he can hear — what was that all about, anyway?

> Was the plot twisting or was that just my brain melting under the surround sound assault? Not clear. Teddy - or was it Freddy? Seeing those fighters clash fists felt a bit like what happens when I accidentally 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a   and my laptop fan decides it’s time to take off. 



And jeez, did my back protest against those seats! Made of the same stuff as tax forms, I’m sure. There’s one scene, the rain pouring down, and I’m just sitting there, thinking — is there such thing as rain envy? My plants at home were thirstier than the protagonist.

> Forgot when you asked me to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , but I’m for sure gonna need to re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it. Maybe twice, maybe it’ll make more sense, like decoding a cat’s meow or assembling IKEA furniture without the manual. 

Got me pondering the protagonist's journey, like when you’re caught between choosing ice cream flavors and all of them seem wrong but so, so right. That fight choreography was like poetry written in jabs and uppercuts — flowing more fluently than I managed to pour soda into my cup without it bubbling over. Really felt it when the part came with the old mentor guy – the one who talks like he’d swallowed a box of fortune cookies and was spouting random prophecies.

Could totally see the outcome coming, but like knowing a train wreck is in motion, you can’t peel your eyes away. Just boom! Everything explodes and you’re left questioning life choices - why did I eat that much popcorn again?

And there it was, the soundtrack echoing in my ears like a friend’s advice you know you’ll never follow but bookmark for a bad day. Gonna try to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it once more after I 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , perhaps on a quieter evening, without the strong smell of stale popcorn and lost dreams.

Let me know if you’re down to join next time. Could use someone else’s brain to decipher why this entire plot felt like it was directed by cats. Or maybe that’s just me still shaking off the Dolby vibes. 

Here’s a random line of code for no good reason:
